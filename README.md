# Harry Potter Invisibility Cloak Project ⚯͛ ❾¾ ⚡🧹

A magical Python-based computer vision project that recreates the famous Deathly Hallow using OpenCV and NumPy.

## ⚯͛ Features

- 🪄 Room of Requirement Mode: Adaptive background scene maintenance
- ✨ Real-time frame processing for smooth invisibility effects
- 🎭 Advanced color detection for identifying the magical cloak
- 🌟 Seamless background blending

## 🧙‍♂️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library
- Solid-colored cloth (Gryffindor red, Slytherin Green, Hufflepuff Yellow or Ravenclaw blue )

## ⚡ Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## 🪄 How It Works

- Captures a static background frame
- Converts video frames to HSV color space for better color detection
- Creates masks to detect the cloak's color
- Replaces the masked area with the background to create the invisibility effect
